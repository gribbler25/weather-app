## Languages and tools Used:

HTML,CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, moment.js, One Call weather API

## Project Description:

This app was created to allow a user to quickly check current weather conditions and

UV index rating to better plan for their day. It also is meant to allow user to see

future conditions for the search city, currently allowing user to see one day into the

future. It also saves immediate search histories for re-searching, if user doesn't refresh browser.

## Some of the challenges I faced:

1. Getting the dynamic local storage values into an array that i could loop over for the buttons was challenging and I still haven't figured out what will fix the problem of the buttons re-creating redundantly when a saved city button is pressed

2. I was very close to getting a for loop to work for populating the child elements of the <ul> in each unique data-id'd <ul>, but javascript is not allowing the value of the data-id to be changed properly by the 'i' value in the loop. So i hard-coded the 1st futureast day to demontrate function.

3. A major challenge in this project was having time to address UI/UX, just barely making most functionality work in the time I had to complete it. Will need some re-tooling in the future to re-submit.

4. I forgot to commit during the 2 straight days I worked on this.
